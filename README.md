Week 4 Assignment ­ Algorithms
Overview
In this week’s assignment, we will be seeing how different search and sort algorithms in the reading
compare to each other in their time efficiency. We’ll be looking at the sequential and binary search
algorithms, as well as the insertion and shell sorting algorithms. Make sure to create a github repository for
this assignment named IS211_Assignment4. All development should be done in this repository.
Useful Reminders
1. Read the assignment over a few times. At least twice. It always helps to have a clear picture of the
overall assignment when understanding how to build a solution.
2. Think about the problem for a while, and even try writing or drawing a solution using pencil and
paper or a whiteboard.
3. Before submitting the assignment, review the “Functional Requirements” section and make sure you
hit all the points. This will not guarantee a perfect score, however.
Part I ­ Search Algorithm Comparison
In this part, we will do a worst­case scenario comparison between the search algorithms in the
reading. For searching, a worst­case scenario is searching for an element that does not exist. Using the
sequential and binary search (both iterative and recursive) functions given in the text, generate a random list
of positive integers and do a benchmark analysis for each one. Make sure to:
1. Create a new file in your repository called search_compare.py.
2. Create four functions, sequential_search, ordered_sequential_search, binary_search_iterative
and binary_search_recursive, and use the code from the section on Sequential and Binary Search
to implement them.
3. Modify each function to calculate how long the function takes and to return this along with the result
of the search function.
a. Do you remember how to return more than one value from a function?
4. The main function of the program should then print how long each function takes, on average. This
should be done by generating 100 random input lists (of positive integers) of size 500, 1000, and
10000, and taking the average run time of the 100 lists.
a. For clarity, you should generate 100 separate lists of size 500, and run each algorithm on
these 100 lists.
b. Since we are doing a worst­case analysis, we should search for an element we know will
not be in the lists. Our lists should be made up of only positive integers, so for this part of
the assignment, we’ll search for the ­1 element. This should never exist, and hence will be a
worst­case scenario.
c. Make sure to print out the result in this format: “Sequential Search took %10.7f seconds to
run, on average”
d. Remember, the binary search functions as well as the ordered sequential search function
requires the list to be sorted. Make sure to sort the list (using Python’s built in list sort()
function; see Part III) before calling the function, so the time it takes to sort the list does not
get included in your calculation for how long it took to search.Food For Thought: How exactly do you plan on doing this? Should we generate all these lists
upfront and then run algorithms on them? Or should we generate them one at a time when
needed? How will you keep track of all the run time values and calculate the average?
Part II ­ Sorting Algorithm Comparison
Similar to above, in this part we will compare a few sorting functions we learned about in the
readings. However, in this case, we will be looking only at the average­case scenario. Perform a benchmark
analysis, just like Part I, with lists of random numbers of the same size, comparing insertion sort, shell sort
and the built­in Python's sort algorithm. The reading material has example Python code that implements
these algorithms. Make sure to:
1. Create a new file in your repository called sort_compare.py.
2. Create three functions, insertion_sort, shell_sort and python_sort. Use the code from the
reading for the first two functions. The python_sort function simply a ‘wrapper’ function that calls
sort() on the input list.
3. Modify these functions to calculate how long the function takes, similar to Part I.
4. The main function of the program should then call these functions for a list of random numbers of
size, 500, 1000, and 10000.
a. Make sure to print it out in the same format as Part I.
